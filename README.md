# Parallel_rank_computation
Multithreading in python for computing rank of input elements parallely.
This python program computes ranks of numbers present in 'number.txt', displays the ranks of input numbers and then prints the numbers in a sorted way based on their ranks (0,1,2,3...).

# To get started:
1. Clone the repo: git clone 
2. If you want to add your input numbers for which you want to compute ranks parallely, then write your numbers in 'number.txt' file
3. To run the program: python rank_compute_python.py
4. Let's go !!!!!!
