# Parallel_rank_computation
Multithreading in python for computing rank of input elements parallely.
This python program computes ranks of numbers present in 'number.txt', displays the ranks of input numbers and then prints the numbers in a sorted way based on their ranks (0,1,2,3...).

# To get started:
1. Enter into the directory where you want to clone this repo. Let's say you start from a root directory and end up having a path like: ~/codes/test$, in the current directory clone the repo 
2. To clone this repo: ~/codes/test$ git clone https://github.com/RudrenduMahindar/Parallel_rank_computation.git
3. Get into the cloned repo folder: ~/codes/test$ cd Parallel_rank_computation
4. If you want to add your input numbers for which you want to compute ranks parallely, then write your numbers in 'number.txt' file inside the cloned repo
5. To run the program: ~/codes/test/Parallel_rank_computation$ python rank_compute_python.py
6. Let's go !!!!!!
