# Parallel_rank_computation
Multithreading in python for computing rank of elements parallely
This program computes ranks of numbers present in number.txt, displays their ranks and then prints the numbers in a sorted way based on the ranks (0,1,2,3...)


Clone the repo
If you want to add your numbers for which you want to compute ranks parallely, then write your numbers in 'number.txt' file
To run the program: python .py
Let's go!!!!
